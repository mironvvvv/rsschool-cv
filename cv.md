### **About me:** 
I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Chemical Technology in 2022. After receiving my diploma, I worked in a water quality laboratory and an environmental laboratory. My responsibilities included performing chemical analyses of water, air, and soil. In June 2024, I decided to resign and start learning a new profession â€“ Frontend Development and UX/UI Design. I'm so excited!

I consider my strengths to be a desire to learn new things, the ability to absorb information well, and good teamwork skills. My goal is to learn new professions and find a job.
